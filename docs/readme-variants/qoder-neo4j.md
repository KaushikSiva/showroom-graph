# SHOWROOM / Connected design memory

**Remember why a piece belongs in the room.**

SHOWROOM models room constraints, styles, products and decisions as connected context. Neo4j relationships support inspectable recommendations, while the application retains the budget and existing furniture through successive instructions.

This presentation focuses on connected memory and engineering execution. Authenticated Qoder CLI 1.1.51 authored five meaningful journey tests, all independently passing. The evidence document contains the exact task, sanitized successful CLI result, file diff and execution record. The complete backend suite passes 46 tests. The graph’s live verification status is recorded separately from any local fallback.

## Direct and discover by voice

Maximize the room and keep typing or dictating directions. Pause holds the visible frame and pauses Orbis generation; Resume continues it. Furniture search now retrieves real Amazon product pages through Exa, with OpenAI speech-to-text beside both inputs. Review the transcript before sending. Missing source prices display “Check price” and are excluded from the priced subtotal. [Actual provider and browser evidence](../../docs/evidence/voice-and-player.md).

Click furniture directly in a live, paused or saved frame to inspect visually similar Amazon matches. New live sessions record locally; **Save & rewind** opens a seekable replay, and **Download video** keeps a separate file. Clips persist in this browser. [Frame shopping and recording evidence](../../docs/evidence/video-shopping.md).

Search requests four Amazon results, reuses cached content and includes visible brand markings, colors and item types in matching. [Measured cache latency](../../docs/evidence/search-latency-live.json). [Render hosting setup](../../docs/deploy-render.md).

## Run and inspect

See [QUICKSTART](../../README.md) for Python/FastAPI, React and local Neo4j startup. Frontend: **http://localhost:5190**. Backend: **http://localhost:8190**. Credentials remain server-side in ignored `.env`.

## Shared-code disclosure

This is **one SHOWROOM codebase** with a presentation-specific README. The live-video, Ambiguous-coworker and Qoder/Neo4j repository packages contain the same backend and frontend source, recorded by SHA-256 in `publication.json`. They are not three independent projects. The participant confirmed cross-event eligibility on September 12, 2026. No event entry, award or hosted application deployment is implied by this repository.

[Canonical live-video repository](https://github.com/KaushikSiva/showroom) · [Ambiguous coworker presentation](https://github.com/KaushikSiva/showroom-coworker) · [Qoder / Neo4j presentation](https://github.com/KaushikSiva/showroom-graph).

Generated video is an illustrative preview; product source links, dimensions, reference images and catalog prices substantiate buying decisions. No hardware benchmark, award win or customer traction is claimed.
